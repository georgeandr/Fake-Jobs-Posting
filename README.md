# Fake Jobs Postings Detection using NLP, Python and PySpark.

A project to get familiar with Natural Language Processing tasks using Python and PySpark libraries such as Spark-NLP, Spark-SQL and others. In this project, I've used some pretrained models to create either sentence or word embeddings which later are fed into a simple neural network, which consists from an input later, two hidden layers and an output layer.

## Setup
* Python 3.8
* Scikit-learn
* Spark-NLP
